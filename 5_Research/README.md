## Electric vehicles now include cars, transit buses, trucks of all sizes, and even big-rig tractor trailers that are at least partially powered by electricity. ##
* Electric vehicles fall into three main categories:

* Battery electric vehicles are powered by electricity stored in a battery pack.
* Plug-in hybrids combine a gasoline or diesel engine with an electric motor and large rechargeable battery.
* Fuel cell vehicles split electrons from hydrogen molecules to produce electricity to run the motor.
